Advent of Code 2021

To me, this advent(ure) is all about learning new techniques and concepts every day.
I'm trying to get out of my comfort zone and use things that are new for me, to just
use them to get a feel for when they work well and when they don't.

So far I've learned about:
- rust (day01, day02)
- pytorch (day03, day04, day05)
-

And hopefully some more before christmas :)
